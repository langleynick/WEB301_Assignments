    <p>On the day I decided to take these pictures it was particulary nice outside. Lately because of fall season being in full swing, it has been colder outside. However, this day the sun was out and I decided I would take a picture of my parent's backyard because you have to cherish what days you have left of nice weather before they're gone!</p>

    <p>This pool keeps alot of memories with it because its been here my entire life! There have been plenty of parties and occassions where I would spend time with friends and family back here in the yards that I will keep with me forever. It may seem like just a simple pool but to me its all of those good times and more. After I finish this assignment I will definitly be relaxing and enjoying this nice day before we dont get any more!</p>
